# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Have you ever wondered what bubble sort looks like? Me neither! However, if you are ever curious, this executable JAR file will show you a very quick step-by-step visualization of how bubble sort works.

Press the space bar after launching the Jar file to watch the array go from this:

![UnsortedImage](Unsorted.png)

To this:

![SortedImage](Sorted.png)

I have also added a version of the sorting algorithm that includes a sort by colour option in the files.
